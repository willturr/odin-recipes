    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe for a lovely simple carbonara that is adapted from Jamie
        Oliver. Jamie seems to think that adding double cream is a good idea,
        but really it adds nothing of substance to the recipe.
    </p>
    <p>He also suggests that it should be served with penne, whereas I prefer a 
        more traditional spaghetti.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients (serves 4-5)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Spaghetti</li>
        <li>200g Parmeganno Regianno</li>
        <li>A Pack of Panchetta/A few sliced bacon rashers</li>
        <li>5 Egg yolks</li>
        <li>Plenty of salt and pepper to season</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pasta in to boil; the sauce can be prepped while it is cooking.</li>
        <li>Grate all the parmesan, why not.</li>
        <li>Separate the yolks from the eggs and place into a bowl, mixing in the cheese</li>
        <li>Season generously with pepper, sparingly with salt.</li>
        <li>Fry the panchetta/bacon till browning, allowing to cool a bit before incorporating into sauce</li>
        <li>Drain pasta once cooked, allowing a few seconds for slight cooling</li>
        <li>Incorporate the pasta and the sauce, keeping the mixture moving so eggs don't cook</li>
        <li>Serve once sauce is fully coating all the pasta, shining in beautiful cheesy radiance</li>
        <li>Serve to those you love.</li>
    </ol>
